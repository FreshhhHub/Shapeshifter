# Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter is a revolutionary clipboard manager that you might know of already. It allows you to copy multiple items and select which item you want to paste later without losing any of them.

# Want to see releases more often?
Developing Shapeshifter is something we do for free, so that you can enjoy it without cost. However, that also means we can only spend our spare time on it.

### Thanks to our supporters
Patreon is what keeps further development of Shapeshifter possible. Thanks to all the Patreon supporters that helped. We'll soon provide a dynamic list showing all supporters.

## Screenshots
Shapeshifter is simple. You hold down CTRL + V, and the following UI pops up. You then navigate to the item you want to paste using your arrow keys (arrow up/down or use some of the actions with arrow right/left), and then release CTRL + V to paste.

### Other colors
The color of Shapeshifter adapts to the color you've chosen as your Windows 10 accent (theme) color. Here's one where those colors are different.

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute to Shapeshifter 6 development! Create a pull request, and we'll look at it. *The repository has a DotSettings ReSharper file included, which comes with the conventions we want to use for this repository. These conventions also contain a few templates for creating Unit Tests.*

# Can Shapeshifter be trusted?
Shapeshifter can be fully trusted, and hopefully having it 100% open-source helps showing that. Shapeshifter will not send your clipboard data to anyone, and if we collect data, it will be 100% anonymous (for instance, how many installs of Shapeshifter we have, or how many downloads).

Some bright developers may have noticed that there are executable files inside the project. These files come from the [EasyHook](https://easyhook.github.io) NuGet package, which is also open source. If you still don't trust that these are the original EasyHook executables, feel free to run an MD5 hash of the ones from the source code and compare them to the originally distributed EasyHook files.
